                <p class="p-4 text-justify ">
                    The history of programming languages spans from documentation of early mechanical computers to
                    modern tools
                    for software development. Early programming languages were highly specialized, relying on
                    mathematical
                    notation and similarly obscure syntax.[1] Throughout the 20th century, research in compiler theory
                    led to
                    the creation of high-level programming languages, which use a more accessible syntax to communicate
                    instructions.

                    The first high-level programming language was Plankalkül, created by Konrad Zuse between 1942 and
                    1945.[2]
                    The first high-level language to have an associated compiler was created by Corrado Böhm in 1951,
                    for his
                    PhD thesis.[3] The first commercially available language was FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslation),
                    developed in
                    1956 (first manual appeared in 1956, but first developed in 1954) by a team led by John Backus at
                    IBM.

                Programming Language is indeed the fundamental unit of today’s tech world. It is considered as the set
                of
                commands and instructions that we give to the machines to perform a particular task. For example, if you
                give some set of instructions to add two numbers then the machine will do it for you and tell you the
                correct answer accordingly. But do you know that Programming Languages are having a long and rich
                history of
                their evolution? And with a similar concern, here in this article, we’ll take a look at the evolution of
                Programming Languages over the period.

            Languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, and C# continue to dominate the development scene. JavaScript, with
            its ubiquity in web development, has expanded its reach through frameworks like Node.js, enabling
            server-side programming. Python’s simplicity and readability have made it a favorite for beginners and
            experts alike, and its robust libraries have established it as a leader in data science and machine
            learning. Java, renowned for its portability and extensive ecosystem, remains a mainstay in large enterprise
            environments, particularly for Android app development. Meanwhile, C# is closely tied to the .NET framework,
            making it a top pick for developing Windows applications.
