        <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.Who we are</h3>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            A programming language is a way for programmers (developers) to communicate with computers. Programming
            languages consist of a set of rules that allows string values to be converted into various ways of
            generating machine code, or, in the case of visual programming languages, graphical elements. rogramming
            languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually defined by a formal
            language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables and mechanisms for error
            handling. An implementation of a programming language in the form of a compiler or interpreter allows
            programs to be executed, either directly or by producing an executable.

        <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Mission</h3>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            Computer Programming aims to train individuals who are educated with theoretical and practical knowledge on
            course programs, basic programming logic, database, internet programming, network systems, web design,
            computer hardware that are specified in accordance with current technologies.

            The department of Computer Programming focuses on collecting information about the problems of business and
            social life and for transactions directed to processing this collected information. Our department mainly
            targets to train qualified graduates who can produce solutions for potential problems and develop algorithms
            and programs.

            Students of OSTIM Technical University-Vocational School of Computer Programming will be taught English
            preparation depending on their requests.

            The medium of instruction of the program is Turkish.

        <h3> &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. Vision</h3>
        <p class="p-4 text-justify">
            The mission of this program is to train computer technicians who have the knowledge and skills required by
            businesses about rapidly increasing computer technologies in our country and in the world, who can adapt to
            changing technology and renew themselves, know and use computer hardware and software well.Computer
            Programming has adopted the vision of training qualified technical staff who can meet the needs of the
            society in accordance with international standards in its field.
